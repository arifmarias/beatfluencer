The AI engineer has successfully progressed the Beatfluencer application through several critical development cycles. The work began with addressing immediate UI/UX inconsistencies, specifically fixing influencer card sizing and resolving complex issues with collapsible social media sections, demonstrating iterative refinement based on direct user feedback. A foundational achievement was rectifying backend authentication failures by implementing a default admin user and extending JWT token validity for improved session management. Subsequently, the engineer focused on significant feature additions, including a comprehensive multi-step Add Influencer form with Cloudinary integration for profile pictures and detailed social media data entry with URL duplication checks. This was followed by building an advanced search and filter system for the influencer management page. The trajectory concludes with ensuring newly created influencers dynamically populate landing page categories and refining the detailed influencer profile modal to meet stringent aesthetic and user experience requirements.

The Beatfluencer web application is an internal platform for an influencer marketing agency, designed to centralize and digitalize influencer and campaign management. Its core purpose is to provide an interactive interface with clear visualizations for internal staff (Admin, Campaign Manager, Influencer Manager), ensuring distinct role-based permissions.

The application is built with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database, leveraging JWT authentication and local file storage. Key features already implemented include:
-   A post-login landing page featuring a natural language search bar and an expandable section for advanced manual filters (Platform, Gender, Age, Follower Count, Experience, Content Category, Account Type, Verification, Location, Industry, Affiliated/Dedicated Brands, Remuneration).
-   A category-based influencer showcase highlighting featured influencers, with an expandable section to display 9 influencer cards and a View All card.
-   A Featured Creators section.
-   A dedicated dashboard for metrics and KPIs.
-   Initial support for Bangladesh localization (BDT currency, local divisions).
-   Specific UI/UX: funky, stylish, animated design, modern navigation, no hero gradient, no influencer picture overlays/descriptions, collapsible social media, uniform small squared cards, no age/verified/featured badges, smaller total followers KPI, first name truncation, no self-category pills.
-   Integrated Beatfluencer logo.

Recent feature additions (during this trajectory):
-   Comprehensive Add Influencer form with 30+ fields (personal, category, remuneration, experience, payment, featured, social media, profile picture upload).
-   Advanced search and filter system for the Influencer page.
-   Dynamic integration of created influencers into landing page categories.
-   Enhanced and aesthetically refined View Profile modal.

    -   **Summary**: The main FastAPI application file, responsible for API routes related to authentication, user management, and influencer data. It manages MongoDB connections using Motor and handles CORS.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Authentication & User Management**: Added a startup event to automatically create a default admin user (/) upon application launch. Increased JWT token expiration time from 30 minutes to 8 hours (480 minutes) to improve session longevity.
        -   **Influencer Data Models**: The  and  Pydantic models were significantly expanded to include all 30+ requested fields (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , and detailed  fields).
        -   **New Endpoints**: Implemented a  endpoint for receiving and uploading profile pictures to Cloudinary. Added an endpoint to check for duplicate social media URLs in the database to prevent redundant entries.
        -   **Error Handling**: Added checks for  responses and provided more specific error details in the logs.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the central React component defining the application's overall structure, including routing, UI components, and core logic for displaying data and handling user interactions.
    -   **Changes**: This file underwent extensive modifications:
        -   **Influencer Card UI/UX**: Iteratively refined  and  components. Ensured uniform sizing (420px height) for all influencer cards and the View All card. Restored and enhanced the collapsible Social Media Presence section, making it dynamically expand to show all social media platforms (adding 32px per platform beyond the initial 3) and ensuring the View Profile button is always visible. Removed Creator â€¢ from the name display, showing only location.
        -   **Category Section Redesign**: Removed Discover amazing creators text and Click to Explore button. Integrated all 26 specified content categories with appropriate Lucide React icons. Reworked the grid layout to display in 5 columns with smaller, more compact cards and a refined aesthetic using softer, more subtle color palettes and glassmorphism effects.
        -   **Add Influencer Form**: Implemented a comprehensive, multi-step  component to capture all 30+ influencer details. This included dynamic array management for remuneration services and social media accounts, date pickers, multi-select checkboxes, and integration of a profile picture upload field with Cloudinary.
        -   **Social Media Form UX**: Enhanced the social media section within the  to first allow multi-selection of platforms, then dynamically render dedicated data entry sections for each selected platform (Channel Name, URL, Created Year/Month, Follower Count, Verification, CPV), with real-time URL duplicate checking.
        -   **Influencer Search & Filters**: Integrated a search bar and a detailed filter panel on the Influencers page, supporting filtering by platforms, gender, experience, category, location, verification status, featured status, and follower/remuneration ranges. Fixed  errors in filter dropdowns by replacing empty string values with all.
